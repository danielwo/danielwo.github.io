Orthogonally Related is yet another blog about mathematics, biology, research, data 
science, coding, learning, passing amusements, and life. I will also write about work,
struggle, music, hiking and many other things which might seem _orthogonally related_.

# Short Bio
![Me](https://danielwo.github.io/assets/images/)

of Texas at Arlington in 2015. I studied structure preserving numerical methods for 
solving dynamical systems and I analyzed disease transmission models in mathematical
epidemiology.
