**Hello!** My name is Daniel Wood. I earned my PhD in mathematics from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2015. As a graduate student I studied structure preserving numerical methods for solving dynamical systems and the analysis of disease transmission models in the context of mathematical epidemiology. After working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center modeling HIV interventions, I joined the team at Pacific Union Financial as a Senior Quantitative Analyst and later joined Caliber Home Loans, where I perform modeling tasks in the mortgage industry.

I enjoy recreational mathematics, participating in MOOCs, playing music, drinking coffee and a large subset of the things people tend to like (e.g. movies, concerts, exercise).
