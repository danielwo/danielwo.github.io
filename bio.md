Let's begin with my name: Daniel Wood. I earned my Ph.D. in mathematics from the University
of Texas at Arlington in 2015. As a graduate student I studied structure preserving numerical methods for 
solving dynamical systems and the analysis of disease transmission models in the context
of mathematical epidemiology. 

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the 
[Vaccines and Infectious Disease Division](http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/vaccine-and-infectious-disease.html)
at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (otherwise known as "The Hutch") in 
Seattle, Washington. At the Hutch, I work with statisticians, biologists, doctors,
graduate students and others, in order to model HIV prevention interventions, with the 
goal of finding ways to help fight the HIV epidemic.

I enjoy recreational mathematics, participating in online MOOCs, playing music, 
drinking coffee and a large subset of the things people tend to like (e.g. movies,
concerts, exercise).
